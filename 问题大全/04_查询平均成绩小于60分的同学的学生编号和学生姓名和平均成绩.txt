-- 4、查询平均成绩小于60分的同学的学生编号和学生姓名和平均成绩 -- (包括有成绩的和无成绩的)
select t1.s_id,t1.s_name ,avg(t2.s_score) as avg  from 
Student as t1 join Score as t2 on t1.s_id = t2.s_id 
group by t1.s_id 
having avg <=60
union 
select t1.s_id ,t1.s_name, 0 as avg from 
Student as t1 where t1.s_id not in (
select t2.s_id from Score as t2)

首先查出了有成绩的同学信息
然后通过Union关联无成绩的同学
无成绩的同学怎么获得,通过多表查询t1.s_id不在t2.s_id里面
